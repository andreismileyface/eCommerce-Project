                <p>There are temporary changes for all travellers, including Canadian citizens, regardless of their
                    vaccination status. The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid
                    particles when they cough, sneeze, speak,
                    sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.

                    <p> Good food, great service and smooth flight. All 4 flights were on time and comfortable. Staff
                        friendly and gave excellent service. Will gladly fly with them again.</p>

                    <p>I really enjoyed this flight. The flight attendants offered excellent service. There was a good
                        selection of wines. The dinner was good but I would have appreciate a third option for the main
                        course. I particularly enjoyed watching
                        the films, documentaries and TV shows. When I am flying longer routes I always try to book on a
                        plane with Signature Service. It's nice to see they've brought that back. I also enjoyed the AC
                        lounge and have a bite to eat and a
                        glass of wine and some water before my flight. The seats are really comfortable and with the
                        seat facing the window, it feels nicely private. I also appreciated the health protocols
                        followed by the AC staff.</p>
